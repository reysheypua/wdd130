            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history">
                <p>Dry Oar Rafting began with a small group of outdoor enthusiasts who shared a love for adventure and
                    the thrill of the
                    river. What started as weekend rafting trips among friends soon turned into a mission to share that
                    same excitement with
                    others. With just a few rafts and a lot of passion, the team started guiding their first tours,
                    focusing on safety,
                    teamwork, and unforgettable experiences.</p>

                <p>Over the years, the company has grown into one of the most trusted rafting outfitters in the region.
                    Thousands of guests
                    have joined our trips, from families seeking fun to thrill-seekers chasing the next big wave. Even
                    as we’ve expanded,
                    our goal remains the same — to help people connect with nature, discover their courage, and create
                    lasting memories on
                    the water.</p>
